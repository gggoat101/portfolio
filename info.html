      <h2>🧠 Volunteer Work</h2>
      <p>I’ve contributed to <strong>Be My Eyes</strong>, a platform that connects volunteers with visually impaired users for real-time assistance. It’s been a meaningful way to use tech for good.</p>

      <h2>🏈 Sports Background</h2>
      <p>I’m a huge sports fan and played football competitively. That experience taught me discipline, teamwork, and how to push through challenges—skills I bring into every project I tackle.</p>
